> A style guide is about consistency. Consistency with this style guide is
> important. Consistency within a project is more important. Consistency within
> one module or function is most important.

> But most importantly: know when to be inconsistent -- sometimes the style guide
> just doesn't apply. When in doubt, use your best judgment. Look at other
> examples and decide what looks best. And don't hesitate to ask!>

> PEP 8, Python
